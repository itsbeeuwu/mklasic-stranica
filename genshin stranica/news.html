			<h2>All you need to know about Balladeer boss fight in one place!</h2>
			<p>The Scaramouche Boss Fight domain is located in Chinvat Ravine, Sumeru in the Avidya Forest <a href="https://genshin-impact-map.appsample.com/?type=o154&id=43732&mid=2"> area.</a></p>
			<p>Scaramouche can be unlocked as a weekly boss fight after completing the Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies quest during Archon Quest Chapter III: Act V. While he doesn't have any Elemental Weaknesses, Scaramouche is resistant to the Electro element! We recommend using any DPS character that does not use the Electro element as their main source of DMG. </p>
			<br>
			<p >During the second phase, Scaramouche can launch an attack that summons multiple elemental bombs that will eventually explode. Use the element each bomb is weak against to destroy it quickly and collect an Energy BlockScaramouche's Nirvana Engines in the second phase are resistant to the Electro and Hydro elements. Use Pyro, Cryo, or Dendro Elemental Attacks to fill up the Neo Akasha Terminal and avoid the one hit knockout move: Setsuna Shoumetsu..</p>
			<br>
			<p>We recommend using characters who can use ranged elemental attacks. Ganyu is an excellent option as her Charged Attacks can deal tons of single target DMG from a distance. Nahida can easily attack the obstacles that provide Energy Blocks while Bennett and Zhongli can protect you from taking huge hits.</p>
			<br>
			<p>To defeat Scaramouche, you must collect Energy Blocks generated from his attacks to charge up the Neo Akasha Terminal. The Neo Akasha Terminal is a device used during battle to immobilize or deal DMG to Shouki no Kami.During the first phase, there will be circular pads on the floor you can step on called Elemental Matrices. Fully charge the Neo Akasha Terminal and use it on the pads to generate the following effects: PYRO, CRYO, ELECTRO and ANEMO.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Using a fully charged Neo Akasha Terminal during the second phase will replace your Elemental Skill with a powerful attack that can deal a huge chunk of DMG. Hold the Skill and aim it on the enemy to unleash a green blast.When Scaramouche's shield in the second phase has been destroyed, attack the Nirvana Engines using Pyro, Cryo, and Dendro to charge up the Akasha Terminal. Once charged up, use it to unleash a blast that can immobilize Shouki no Kami. Failure to do so will have one of your party members killed by the Setsuna Shoumetsu attack.</p>
